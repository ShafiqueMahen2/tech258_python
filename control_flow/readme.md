# Control Flow Tasks

## Task 1

This task is about creating a program that checks if a user can watch a movie based on the users age. This is done through a if/elif block. By comparing the stored data in `film_rating` variable to the rating in the if/elif condition. The program will be able to determine and print the suitability of the movie based on the rating.

The code itself goes through each classification being Universal, PG, 12, 12A, 15, 18 and if the `film_rating` variable doesn't match it will continue to the next elif. However, if a match is found the code prints the corresponding statement and terminates. If there is no match, the print statement in the else block is printed instead, prompting the user to store a correct classification in the `film_rating` variable.
